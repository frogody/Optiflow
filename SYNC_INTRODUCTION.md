## Real-World Use Cases

### AI-Powered Proposal Generation

Sarah, a sales executive, receives an email from a potential client requesting a proposal for Sync services. Instead of spending hours manually creating this document, she simply asks the Sync voice agent:

"Hey Sync, I just received an email from TechCorp requesting a proposal for our enterprise plan. Can you help me create a personalized proposal?"

Sync's voice agent, powered by LiveKit and Claude AI, immediately:

1. Accesses Sarah's Gmail account to read and analyze the client's email, extracting key requirements and information
2. Queries Salesforce to retrieve current pricing information and applicable discounts
3. Uses Claude's advanced reasoning to draft a comprehensive proposal document, including:
   - Personalized executive summary addressing client's specific needs
   - Recommended service package with justifications
   - Accurate pricing information with appropriate discounts
   - Implementation timeline and resource requirements
4. Sends the proposal draft to Sarah's email for review
5. When Sarah says "Looks good, please send it to the client," the agent:
   - Creates a professional PDF with proper formatting and branding
   - Composes a personalized email with the proposal attached
   - Sends it directly to the client through Sarah's Gmail account
   - Creates a follow-up task in Salesforce with a reminder for Sarah

This entire process, which would typically take several hours of focused work across multiple systems, is completed in minutes through simple voice interactions.

### Sales Team Efficiency

The sales team at TechCorp uses Sync to streamline their deal process:

1. When a sales rep conducts a customer call through Sync, the voice agent automatically:
   - Transcribes the entire conversation
   - Updates the Salesforce opportunity record
   - Creates follow-up tasks in the CRM
   - Drafts a personalized email for approval
   - Schedules the next meeting with calendar integration

2. This process, which previously took 45 minutes of manual work after each call, now happens instantly—allowing the team to focus on building relationships instead of data entry.

### Cross-Functional Project Collaboration

When launching a new product, teams across marketing, product, and engineering use Sync to coordinate:

1. The workflow editor creates a custom approval process that:
   - Routes designs from Figma to the right stakeholders
   - Tracks approvals and feedback through a unified dashboard
   - Automates notifications across Slack and email
   - Triggers downstream actions when milestones are completed

2. Teams collaborate in real-time with AI agents that provide insights, documentation, and automation—all within the same platform.

   - The voice agent uses the ClaudeWrapper service to connect to Gmail via Pipedream integration
   - Claude analyzes the email content to identify requirements, timeline, and specific needs

2. **Data Gathering & Analysis**:
   - Claude identifies that pricing information is needed
   - The system queries Salesforce through the Pipedream integration to retrieve:
     - Current pricing tiers for the client's size and industry
     - Available discounts and promotions
     - Historical transaction data for similar clients

3. **Intelligent Document Creation**:

     - Executive summary with personalized value proposition
     - Detailed service offerings addressing specific client needs
     - Accurate pricing with appropriate discounting

   - Sarah can request modifications through natural language: "Add more details about our security features"
   - Claude understands the context and makes targeted changes to the document

5. **Client Delivery**:
   - After approval, Sarah instructs Sync to "Send the proposal to the client"
   - The system creates a professional PDF attachment
   - It composes a personalized email with appropriate messaging
   - The email is sent through Sarah's Gmail account, maintaining her professional identity
   - A record of the proposal and communication is stored in Salesforce

This seamless workflow demonstrates the power of combining advanced AI reasoning with deep integrations, enabling complex business processes that would typically require hours of manual work across multiple systems to be completed in minutes through simple voice interactions.
