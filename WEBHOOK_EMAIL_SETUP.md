# Setting Up Webhook-Based Email with Pipedream

## Updated Email Configuration

Based on your Pipedream setup, I've modified the code to use webhook-based email sending instead of the SDK approach. Follow these instructions to complete the setup:

## 1. Add Your Webhook URL to Environment Variables

Add the following environment variable to your project:

```
PIPEDREAM_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL=https://eoqy849vdowjz0r.m.pipedream.net
```

(Replace with your actual Pipedream webhook URL from the Pipedream dashboard)

### For Local Development:

Create or edit the `.env.local` file in your project root and add:

```
PIPEDREAM_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL=https://eoqy849vdowjz0r.m.pipedream.net
```

### For Vercel Deployment:

1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to Environment Variables
3. Add a new variable named `PIPEDREAM_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL` with your Pipedream webhook URL
4. Save the changes and redeploy your application

## 2. Test Your Webhook Integration

Once you've added the webhook URL environment variable, try approving a beta request to test if the email is sent correctly. The system will now:

1. Call your Pipedream webhook URL when an email needs to be sent
2. Pass the email details (to, subject, body, etc.) as JSON data
3. Let Pipedream handle the actual email delivery

## 3. Verify in Pipedream

After attempting to send an email:

1. Check your Pipedream dashboard to see if the webhook was triggered
2. Look at the event data to make sure the right information was sent
3. Verify that the email was delivered to the recipient

## Technical Details

The updated code in `src/lib/pipedream/email.ts` now:

- Uses `fetch()` to make an HTTP POST request to your Pipedream webhook
- Sends the email data as JSON in the request body
- Handles errors and logs the delivery attempt
- No longer requires the Pipedream SDK for this specific functionality

If you need to debug the email sending, check the logs in your deployment platform for any error messages.
