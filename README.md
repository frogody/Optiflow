# Optiflow

Optiflow is a next-generation, AI-powered workflow and communication platform designed for seamless multi-user, multi-agent collaboration. It enables users to connect their favorite SaaS tools, orchestrate advanced automations, and interact with intelligent agents‚Äîall in real time, with robust voice and chat capabilities.

## üöÄ Overview

Optiflow brings together real-time communication, AI orchestration, and deep SaaS integrations to create a "Jarvis-like" assistant for modern teams. Each user gets a persistent, secure LiveKit room where they can interact with agents (LLMs), connect their own SaaS accounts (via Pipedream), and automate complex workflows with natural language.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Persistent LiveKit Rooms:** Each user has a dedicated, secure room for voice and chat, with multi-user and multi-agent support.

- **Pipedream Connect Integrations:** Users can connect their own accounts for 30+ SaaS tools (Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, Notion, etc.) and automate actions securely.
- **Memory & Context:** All conversations and actions are stored in Mem0, providing agents with persistent, context-aware memory.
- **Modern Frontend:** A beautiful, responsive UI with a persistent voice agent orb, notifications, and easy access to settings and integrations.
- **Production-Ready Security:** All sensitive operations are server-side, with robust access control and data privacy.
