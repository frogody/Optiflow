## üåü Real-World Use Cases

### Executive Productivity

Sarah, a busy CMO, starts her day with Sync's voice assistant:

"Good morning, I need to prepare for the marketing review meeting this afternoon."

Sync's voice agent, powered by LiveKit and Claude AI, immediately:
- Retrieves the latest campaign analytics from HubSpot
- Gathers team progress updates from Asana
- Compiles feedback from Slack conversations
- Creates a meeting brief with actionable insights
- Adds it to her calendar with notifications to the team

All of this happens through a single voice interaction, saving Sarah hours of manual work across multiple platforms.

### Sales Team Efficiency

The sales team at TechCorp uses Sync to streamline their deal process:

1. When a sales rep conducts a customer call through Sync, the voice agent automatically:
   - Transcribes the entire conversation
   - Updates the Salesforce opportunity record
   - Creates follow-up tasks in the CRM
   - Drafts a personalized email for approval
   - Schedules the next meeting with calendar integration

2. This process, which previously took 45 minutes of manual work after each call, now happens instantly‚Äîallowing the team to focus on building relationships instead of data entry.

### Cross-Functional Project Collaboration

When launching a new product, teams across marketing, product, and engineering use Sync to coordinate:

1. The workflow editor creates a custom approval process that:
   - Routes designs from Figma to the right stakeholders
   - Tracks approvals and feedback through a unified dashboard
   - Automates notifications across Slack and email
   - Triggers downstream actions when milestones are completed

2. Teams collaborate in real-time with AI agents that provide insights, documentation, and automation‚Äîall within the same platform.
