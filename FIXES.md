## Common Issues Fixed

### Cross-Browser Compatibility

- **Safari backdrop-filter support**: Adds appropriate vendor prefixes and fallbacks for unsupported features
- **WebKit text rendering**: Ensures gradient text works properly in all browsers
- **Mobile Safari fixes**: Handles various quirks in iOS Safari like 100vh, sticky positioning, etc.

### CSS Cleanup

- **Will-change optimization**: Removes duplicate will-change declarations

### Environment Variables

- Ensures all required environment variables exist in GitHub workflow files
- Updates Vercel deployment configurations
- Adds LiveKit and other API configurations

### Animation Performance

- Adds appropriate will-change hints for better performance
- Ensures hardware acceleration for animations
- Provides vendor-specific transformation prefixes

### React Component Syntax Issues

- Incorrect component function declarations
- Missing return statements in components
- Missing brackets in JSX returns
- Props interface definition syntax errors

### TypeScript Syntax Issues

- Missing semicolons in import/export statements
- Missing commas in object property assignments
- Incorrect function arrow syntax
- Interface and type definition syntax issues

### TypeScript Linting Issues

- **Unused variables**: Prefixes unused variables with underscore
- **React Hooks**: Adds appropriate ESLint disable comments for hooks dependencies
- **Prefer const**: Converts var declarations to const where appropriate
- **Proper importing**: Fixes import issues and unused imports

## How The Fixes Work

These scripts scan the codebase for specific patterns and apply fixes automatically. They're designed to be non-destructive and only modify what needs to be fixed.

Each script provides detailed output of what was changed, making it easy to track modifications.

## When To Run These Scripts

Run these scripts in the following situations:

1. After pulling new code that might have introduced compatibility issues
2. Before deploying to production
3. When testing reveals browser-specific problems
4. When adding new environment variables or integrations
5. When ESLint shows warnings that need to be fixed

## Adding Custom Fixes

To add new fixes, edit the appropriate script and add new patterns to the `patterns` array. Each pattern should include:

- `find`: A regular expression pattern to match
- `replace`: The replacement string or function
- `stat`: The statistic to track for reporting

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after running these scripts:

1. Check the console output for any errors
2. Run individual scripts to isolate the problem
3. Use `git diff` to see exactly what was changed

## Contributing

When adding new features that might have cross-browser compatibility concerns, please:

1. Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile browsers)
2. Add appropriate fixes to these scripts if needed
3. Document any browser-specific workarounds you discover
