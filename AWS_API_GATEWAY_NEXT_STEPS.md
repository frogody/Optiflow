# AWS API Gateway Integration - Next Steps

## What We've Done

1. **Implemented Proper Authentication Mechanism**:
   - Modified `VoiceAgentInterface.tsx` to add proper API key authentication
   - Removed the temporary mock/bypass solution
   - Set up environment variables for API Gateway configuration

2. **Created Setup and Testing Tools**:
   - `quick-aws-setup.sh` - Script to set up temporary API key configuration
   - `test-aws-api-gateway.js` - Tests multiple common API Gateway endpoints
   - `simple-aws-test.js` - Simple test for a specific endpoint with API key
   - `aws-endpoint-logger.js` - Browser tool to log API Gateway endpoints being accessed

3. **Added Documentation**:
   - `AWS_API_GATEWAY_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup instructions
   - `AWS_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of the implementation
   - References in README-VOICE-AGENT.md

## Current Status

The API Gateway endpoint testing is returning 404 errors, which indicates:
1. The endpoint paths we're testing don't match the actual paths in your API Gateway
2. The AWS API Gateway ID (`sfd8q2ch3k`) might not be correct or accessible

## Next Steps

1. **Identify Correct API Gateway Endpoints**:
   - Check the AWS Console to find the correct API Gateway ID and endpoint paths
   - Use the `aws-endpoint-logger.js` tool in development to capture actual endpoints being used
   - Update scripts with the correct endpoints

2. **Create or Configure API Gateway in AWS**:
   - If you haven't created an API Gateway, follow the AWS Console to create one
   - Add the necessary endpoints that match what the voice agent is expecting
   - Configure API key authorization on the methods

3. **Generate a Real API Key**:
   - Once the correct API Gateway is identified, run `./setup-aws-api-key.sh` with the correct API ID
   - This will create a real API key in AWS and update your environment variables

4. **Deploy with Complete Configuration**:
   - After verifying that the API key works with `simple-aws-test.js`, deploy your application
   - Use `./deploy-to-vercel.sh` to deploy with the proper environment variables

## Using the Endpoint Logger

To find which API Gateway endpoints your application is actually trying to use:

1. Run the application in development mode
2. Open your browser console
3. Interact with the voice agent to trigger API Gateway calls
4. Check the console for logged endpoints from the `aws-endpoint-logger.js` tool
5. Use `window.printAwsEndpoints()` in the console to see all endpoints that have been accessed

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing 403 Forbidden errors after setup:

1. Verify the API Gateway has API key requirement enabled for the endpoints
2. Make sure the API key is associated with a usage plan that includes your API Gateway
3. Check CORS settings if requests are coming from a different origin
4. Ensure the API Gateway deployment is up to date after making changes

For any persistent issues, check AWS CloudWatch logs for detailed error information from the API Gateway.

## Final Note

Once you have identified the correct API Gateway ID and endpoints, update the following files:
- `.env.local` and `.env.production` with the correct values
- Update the default endpoints in testing scripts
- Re-run your tests to confirm authentication is working

After completing these steps, your voice agent should successfully authenticate with AWS API Gateway.
