# Vercel Deployment Summary

## Deployment Status

The Optiflow application has been deployed to Vercel. The latest deployments can be found at:

- https://optiflow-q3hqc6tsb-isyncso.vercel.app (Ready)
- https://optiflow-gk98496qf-isyncso.vercel.app (Build Error)

## Deployment Issues

The build process is currently failing with an error in the `npm run build` command. The build log would provide more details, but unfortunately, Vercel isn't showing the logs directly.

## Required Steps to Fix Deployment

1. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Set up all required environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
   - Make sure Pipedream credentials are properly configured
   - Ensure database connection strings are correct for production

2. **Fix Build Issues**
   - Identify TypeScript errors or other build failures
   - Check dependency compatibility
   - Verify that all required configuration files are present

3. **Verify API Routes**
   - Ensure all API routes are properly implemented
   - Verify OAuth callback routes are functional

## Using the Enhanced Deployment Scripts

We've created several tools to help with deployment:

1. **deploy-to-vercel.sh**
   - Enhanced with better error handling and debugging
   - Verifies environment variables before deployment
   - Provides better guidance for resolving common issues

2. **update-vercel-env.sh**
   - Updates the `.env.production` file with correct URLs
   - Provides instructions for setting up environment variables in Vercel

3. **test-pipedream-integration.js**
   - Tests connectivity to the deployed application
   - Verifies the Pipedream callback endpoint
   - Guides through manual OAuth testing

4. **PIPEDREAM_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md**
   - Comprehensive checklist for verifying deployment
   - Covers all aspects of the Pipedream integration

## Next Steps

1. **Fix the build issues**
   - Run `npm run build` locally to identify problems
   - Update the codebase to resolve any errors

2. **Configure environment variables in Vercel**
   - Follow instructions in `update-vercel-env.sh` for required variables

3. **Deploy again using the enhanced script**
   - Run `./deploy-to-vercel.sh` to deploy with better error handling

4. **Test the deployed application**
   - Use `node test-pipedream-integration.js` after deployment
   - Complete the checklist in `PIPEDREAM_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

5. **Configure Pipedream OAuth**
   - Update the redirect URI in your Pipedream OAuth app to match your deployed URL

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to encounter deployment issues:

1. Check the Vercel build logs through the dashboard
2. Run the build locally with the same environment variables
3. Consider simplifying the build process temporarily to identify specific issues
4. Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json
5. Verify Node.js version compatibility between local and Vercel environments
