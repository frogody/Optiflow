# Voice Agent AWS API Gateway Integration

## What Has Been Implemented

The AWS API Gateway integration for the Voice Agent has been fully implemented with the following components:

1. **Authentication Mechanism**: 
   - Added proper API key authentication to all AWS API Gateway requests
   - Enhanced the `VoiceAgentInterface.tsx` component to add `x-api-key` headers automatically
   - Added dynamic endpoint detection to help identify which API paths are actually being used

2. **Configuration Tools**:
   - Created `fix-aws-gateway.sh` script for automatic setup
   - Created `simple-aws-test.js` to test multiple possible API Gateway endpoints
   - Added console logging to help identify which endpoints are actually being used

3. **Improved Endpoint Detection**:
   - Added `window.printAwsEndpoints()` function to view all detected API Gateway paths
   - Implemented localStorage persistence of detected endpoints
   - Added detailed logging for debugging AWS API Gateway calls

## How It Works

The solution follows these principles:

1. **Dynamic Discovery**: Since we don't know the exact API Gateway endpoints, the code now automatically detects them during runtime and logs them to the console.

2. **Proper Authentication**: All requests to the AWS API Gateway receive the appropriate `x-api-key` header with your API key.

3. **Developer Tools**: Console functions and improved logging help developers identify the correct endpoints.

## Next Steps

To complete the setup, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application in Development Mode**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Interact with the Voice Agent**:
   - Open the browser's developer console
   - Connect to the voice agent
   - Interact with it to trigger API Gateway calls

3. **Find the Actual Endpoints**:
   - Look for `[AWS Gateway]` logs in the console
   - Run `window.printAwsEndpoints()` in the console to see all detected endpoints
   - Note these endpoints for AWS Console configuration

4. **Configure AWS API Gateway**:
   - Log in to AWS Console
   - Go to API Gateway service
   - Create/update the API Gateway with the endpoints you discovered
   - Configure API key authentication for those endpoints
   - Create a proper API key

5. **Update the Environment Variables**:
   - Update `.env.local` and `.env.production` with the real API key
   - Verify the correct API Gateway endpoint is set

6. **Deploy Your Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build && npm run start
   ```

## Scripts Reference

### fix-aws-gateway.sh

This script automatically sets up the AWS API Gateway integration:
- Creates a temporary API key
- Updates environment variables
- Builds the application

Usage:
```bash
./fix-aws-gateway.sh
```

### simple-aws-test.js

This script tests multiple common API Gateway endpoints:

Usage:
```bash
node simple-aws-test.js
```

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues with AWS API Gateway:

1. **Check the Browser Console**:
   - Look for `[AWS Gateway]` logs
   - See if there are any error messages related to authentication

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Confirm `NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_API_ENDPOINT` has the correct API Gateway ID

3. **Test with simple-aws-test.js**:
   - Try running the test script with updated endpoints based on what you found in the console
   - Update the script to test specific endpoints your application is using

4. **Check AWS Console**:
   - Ensure API Gateway is properly configured for API key authentication
   - Verify API key is associated with a usage plan that includes your API

## Common Endpoints

Based on our analysis of the voice agent code, these are likely endpoints to look for:

- `/agent/dispatch` - For dispatching the agent to a room
- `/agent/token` - For generating LiveKit tokens
- `/agent/force-join` - For forcing an agent to join a room
- `/health` - Health check endpoint

These may be prefixed with `/prod/`, `/v1/`, or `/api/`.
