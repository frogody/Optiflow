# Pipedream Integration Deployment Checklist

After deploying your application to Vercel, follow this checklist to ensure your Pipedream integration is properly configured and working.

## 1. Verify Application Deployment

- [ ] Application has been successfully deployed to Vercel
- [ ] Application is accessible at the deployment URL (e.g., `https://optiflow-q3hqc6tsb-isyncso.vercel.app`)
- [ ] All pages load correctly without errors

## 2. Environment Variables Configuration

Make sure the following environment variables are configured in your Vercel project:

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID` set to your Pipedream OAuth app client ID
- [ ] `PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET` set to your Pipedream OAuth app client secret
- [ ] `PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID` set to your Pipedream project ID
- [ ] `PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` set to "production"
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` set to your deployment URL
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_PIPEDREAM_REDIRECT_URI` set to your deployment URL + "/api/pipedream/callback"
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` set to your deployment URL
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` set to a secure random string
- [ ] `AUTH_SECRET` set to a secure random string
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` set to your production database connection string

## 3. Pipedream OAuth App Configuration

- [ ] Pipedream OAuth app is created in your Pipedream account
- [ ] Redirect URI in Pipedream OAuth app is set to your deployment URL + "/api/pipedream/callback"
- [ ] Necessary scopes are selected for your application

## 4. Testing the Integration

- [ ] User can log in to your application
- [ ] User can navigate to the workflow creation page
- [ ] When creating a workflow, user can connect external services via Pipedream
- [ ] OAuth flow initiates correctly when connecting a service
- [ ] After authorizing, user is redirected back to your application
- [ ] Connection information is saved in your application

## 5. Callback Endpoint Testing

- [ ] `/api/pipedream/callback` endpoint is accessible
- [ ] Endpoint correctly handles OAuth success response
- [ ] Endpoint correctly handles OAuth error response
- [ ] User session is maintained throughout the OAuth flow

## 6. Security Considerations

- [ ] All sensitive credentials are stored securely
- [ ] Client secret is never exposed in the frontend code
- [ ] All communication uses HTTPS
- [ ] Session management is implemented securely

## 7. Error Handling

- [ ] Application handles connection failures gracefully
- [ ] User receives clear error messages when something goes wrong
- [ ] Application provides clear instructions for recovery

## 8. Monitoring and Logging

- [ ] Request logs are available in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Error tracking is implemented
- [ ] OAuth flow errors are properly logged for debugging

## 9. Documentation

- [ ] Integration instructions are updated for the production environment
- [ ] Troubleshooting information is available for users
- [ ] Contact support information is clearly provided

## 10. Performance

- [ ] OAuth flow completes in a reasonable time
- [ ] Application remains responsive during the OAuth process
- [ ] Connection management UI is optimized for user experience

Complete this checklist after each deployment to ensure your Pipedream integration is functioning correctly.
