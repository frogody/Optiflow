# Pipedream Connect Integration Plan

This document outlines the steps to integrate the Pipedream Connect example into our Optiflow project.

## 1. Environment Setup

- [x] Clone the Pipedream Connect example repository
- [ ] Compare environment variables between our project and the example
- [ ] Create or update our `.env.local` and `.env.production` files with necessary Pipedream Connect variables

## 2. Dependencies

- [ ] Verify that we have `@pipedream/sdk` installed (already done in our project)
- [ ] Ensure we're using the correct version of the SDK

## 3. Server-Side Implementation

- [ ] Create or update server functions for Pipedream Connect:
  - [ ] `serverConnectTokenCreate` - Generate tokens for users
  - [ ] `getAppInfo` - Retrieve app information
  - [ ] `getUserAccounts` - Get user's connected accounts

## 4. Client-Side Implementation

- [ ] Update our existing PipedreamConnector component to match the example's functionality
- [ ] Add proper error handling and loading states
- [ ] Implement the OAuth app ID handling

## 5. UI Integration

- [ ] Update our workflow editor to include Pipedream Connect functionality
- [ ] Add a managed app connection flow that matches the example
- [ ] Style the UI to match our application's design

## 6. Testing

- [ ] Test the connection flow with various apps:
  - [ ] OAuth-based apps (Slack, Gmail, etc.)
  - [ ] API key-based apps
- [ ] Test error scenarios and handling

## 7. Deployment Configuration

- [ ] Set up Vercel deployment variables
- [ ] Configure production environment settings for Pipedream
- [ ] Update callback URLs for OAuth providers

## 8. Documentation

- [ ] Document the integration process
- [ ] Create user documentation for connecting apps
- [ ] Create developer documentation for extending the integration

## Key Files to Create/Modify

1. `src/lib/pipedream/server.ts` - Server-side Pipedream functions
2. `src/components/workflow/PipedreamConnector.tsx` - Updated connector component
3. `src/app/api/pipedream/callback/route.ts` - Callback handler for OAuth flow
4. `src/app/workflow-editor/connect/page.tsx` - Connection management page

## Timeline

- Day 1: Environment setup and server-side implementation
- Day 2: Client-side implementation and UI integration
- Day 3: Testing and deployment configuration
- Day 4: Documentation and final adjustments
